# LMS Project - Build Remaining Pages

## Information Gathered
- Existing pages like courses.html, students.html, trainers.html, assignments.html have HTML structure with sidebar, main content, cards, tables, modals.
- Styles are in assets/css/admin.css, updated with dashboard-specific styles.
- JS files are separate, e.g., student.js, trainer.js.
- Some pages like about.html, contact.html are static.

## Plan
1. **Update existing HTML files if needed** (e.g., add full functionality to assignments.html).
2. **Create HTML for remaining pages**:
   - materials.html
   - live.html
   - recorded.html
   - users.html
   - notifications.html
   - settings.html
   - about.html (static)
   - contact.html (static)
3. **Create corresponding JS files** for dynamic pages:
   - materials.js
   - live.js
   - recorded.js
   - users.js
   - notifications.js
   - settings.js
4. **Ensure consistency** with existing pages.

## Completed Tasks
- **courses.html**: Added edit functionality for courses, including editCourse and updateCourse functions.

## Dependent Files to be edited
- assets/css/admin.css (already updated)
- New HTML and JS files

## Followup steps
- Verify each page renders correctly.
- Test functionality like search, add/edit/delete.
- Run the application to check for errors.
