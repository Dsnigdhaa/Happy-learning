# LMS Project - Fix Sidebars and Icons

## Information Gathered
- Sidebars were inconsistent: some had <aside> with logo and "Happy Learning", others <div> with "Admin Panel" no logo.
- Some pages were missing Font Awesome CSS link, causing icons not to display.

## Plan
- Standardize all sidebars to <aside class="sidebar"> with logo and "Happy Learning".
- Add Font Awesome CSS link to all admin pages missing it.

## Completed Tasks
- Standardized sidebars across all admin pages.
- Added Font Awesome CSS link to all admin pages that were missing it.
- Fixed active class for navigation highlighting.

## Dependent Files to be edited
- All admin/*.html files

## Followup steps
- Verify sidebars are consistent and icons display correctly.
- Test navigation highlighting.
